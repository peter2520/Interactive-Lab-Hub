# Final Project

## Project Plan

### Big Idea

We are building a Party Christmas Tree which is a must for us to have a party. The party Christmas Tree will vibrate when seeing people dancing in front of it. And people can control the lights and music of trees by MQTT. Furthermore, the tree can detect the age of the person and give different interactions (e.g. ask a child to take gifts when they detect a child passing by). We believe that this tree is the tree that everyone needs at home.

### Timeline

11/22: Confirm the materials we need for Raspberry Pi

11/29: Finish Function Design/Test

12/06: Final Presentation

### Parts Needed

- Interactive Christmas Tree with Light, Vibration and Music
- Sensors: Webcam, Microphone
- Control: Buttons, Rotate Encoder, MQTT, servo motor


### Risks/Contingencies

The tree may not recognize dance accurately because it is hard to separate dance and other actions by the machine learning approach. Given that the tree is tall and heavy, it is hard to make the tree vibrate. We may need a powerful motor or vibration device for our project.

### Fall-back Plan


Here is what we are going to present in the class:

Using the tools and techniques you learned in this class, design, prototype and test an interactive device.

Project plan - November 15

Peer feedback on Project plans: November 17

Functional check-off - November 29 & December 1

Final Project Presentations - December 6

Write-up and documentation due - December 12

## Objective

The goal of this final project is for you to have a fully functioning and well-designed interactive device of your own design.
 
## Description
Your project is to design and build an interactive device to suit a specific application of your choosing, and test the interaction with people. 

## Deliverables

1. Project plan: Big idea, timeline, parts needed, fall-back plan.

2. Functioning project: The finished project should be a device, system, interface, etc. that people can interact with.

3. Documentation of design process
4. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
5. Video of someone using your project
6. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)

7. Group work distribution questionnaire

## Change of Design

It is fine to change your project goals, but please resubmit the project plan for the new design when you do that.


## Teams

You can and are not required to work in teams. Be clear in documentation who contributed what. The total project contributions should reflect the number of people on the project.

## Examples

[Here is a list of good final projects from previous classes.](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/Previous-Final-Projects)
This version of the class is very different, but it may be useful to see these.
